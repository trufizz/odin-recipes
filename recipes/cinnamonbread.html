    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a super quick cinnamon swirl bread made from a batter that is wonderfully moist and yummy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Mix together 1/3 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine egg, milk, and oil in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture. Stir until just moistened.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon-sugar mixture. Draw a knife through batter to marble.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap in foil and let sit overnight before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
